This is a Julia package to help define distance metrics, primarily for [indirect inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_inference). Most of the functionality is trivial, in the sense that one could just as easily code it up in a few lines, but the advantage of having it in a package is that it can be documented and tested.

I use it in my own work, won't be registered until the API stabilizes.
